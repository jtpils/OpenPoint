# OpenPoint
Deep learning for point sets is hot topic and there are many works try to generate more powerful representation of the point for classifcation or semantic segmentation.

In this projoect, we try to provie a flexible and easy-to-use implementation of the existing works for point cloud. It would be helful for the future research and application. We plant to support the pioneer work: PointNet[1] and PointNet++.
